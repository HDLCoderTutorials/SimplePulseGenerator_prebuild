# Readme - SimplePulseGenerator
Pulse generator, with added logic for a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and a chirp frequency.
As implemented, all data is sent back in realtime, which puts a low limit on the supported PRF due to 
the bottleneck witin the Matlab data unpacking logic through the ethernet path.  
Only the block RAM is used for caching, which is a very limited resource.

A DRAM Memory controller will be needed to cache recorded data from pultiple pulses to form a CPI for 
processing.


#### To Do
- [x] Initialize LFS - run `git lfs install` on the CLI or setup LFS in GitKraken
- [x] Fix initialization of first pulse
- [x] Add support for negative starting frequency f0, but positive f1
- [x] Support negative starting frequencies in Host_IO_DataCapture.slx interface
- [x] Replace array of discrete HDL NCO blocks with a single For block
- [ ] Add support for negative chirps (f0 > f1 )
- [x] Integrate custom replacement for HDL Counter with increment input port
- [x] Build bitstream for chirped pulse
- [ ] Run chirped pulse on hardware and verify output

##### Git Large File Storage
[Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
provides a way to handle large binary files in the normal Git workflow without causing repo bloat.
This repository is setup to allow Git LFS to manage the ~33MB bit file generated by the hdl workflow:  
```hdl_prj/vivado_ip_prj/vivado_prj.runs/impl_1/system_wrapper.bit```

**Git LFS Quick Start**  
On the CLI run `git lfs install` and you are done.  
Or in GitKraken, click File > Preferences > LFS then press "Initialize LFS on this repo."
